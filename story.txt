On a cold Thursday afternoon in Madison, Wisconsin, a student named Bob is walking to his CS 400 exam. On his way there, he sees a hotdog stand and considers skipping the exam to eat some hotdogs instead, but he decides not to because his grade in the class is already low enough. Bob is not the best student on campus and only studied for the exam for 30 minutes late last night. Bob realizes that he will probably do very poorly on the exam today.

As Bob realizes his true fate, he realizes th CS is not his future, but rather eating
hotdogs. As a result, he impusively sells his car and buys the hot dog stand.
He then proceeds to eat 100 hotdogs

He continues to taste hotdogs from all over the world, and eventually develops his own brand "BOB HOT".
He made a fortune and donated all the money.
